# Identification of Regulatory Methylation Hotspots in HIV Infection through Integrated Omics Approach and Machine Learning Framework

## Overview
This project integrates transcriptomic and methylomic data with machine learning to uncover epigenetic drivers of immune dysfunction in HIV infection. It identifies seven key Regulatory Methylation Hotspots (RMHs) linked to pathways such as TGF-Î² signaling, immune suppression, and redox imbalance. These findings highlight novel biomarkers and regulatory targets for understanding HIV pathogenesis.
